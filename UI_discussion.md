UI should basically consist of just a few screens:

* The "room" screen; "gamemaster" creates a room that other people can join before the game starts
* The list of rooms screen: Just a list of open rooms basically that people can click on to join
* Player's screen: The screen that players get sent to after a game is started; basically it will just have their balls on them, and we can grey out sunk balls or something as the game goes on
* Gamemaster's screen: Should have the same thing as the player's screen, but the gamemaster is also responsible for logging the pocketing of any balls, so it would have an additional section to the side where he could select a ball to mark as pocketed
* A basic login screen and signup screen
* Also, just like a homescreen would probably be good with buttons like:
    * sign up
    * log in
    * join a game
    * create a game
