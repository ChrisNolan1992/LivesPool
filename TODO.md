# Future TODO
* Keep history
    * Currently, a lot of fields have a `current_` prefix; we should be storing data for completed games etc. for...;
    * A `Player` page where users can see past played games/stats/info etc.
* Tournament Mode (or something similar)
* Optionally registering with email to be able to restore your password etc.
* Coroutines/Celery/explore asynchronous things
* Back-end unittests (functional tests currently implemented are probably sufficient; however, these would be useful as an additional measure of stability)
